# 🚀 My Daily Coding Grind 🚀

Welcome to my personal coding repository! This is where I document my daily journey of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from various platforms. Think of it as my digital workout journal, but for coding. 💪

***

## 🧐 What's Inside?

This repo is a living collection of my solutions, organized by the platform or topic they come from. It's my way of tracking progress, reinforcing concepts, and building a solid foundation in problem-solving.

## 📁 Repository Structure

My solutions are organized into a few key folders to keep things tidy:

* **`Strivers A2Z`**: A collection of my solutions for the problems in Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet, covering topics from basics to advanced.
* **`Strivers SDE Sheet`**: Contains my solutions to the problems from the extremely popular SDE Sheet by Striver (Raj Vikramaditya), covering essential topics for tech interviews.
* **`General_Leetcode`**: A collection of random LeetCode problems I've solved, often categorized by topic like Dynamic Programming or Sliding Window.
* **`POTD`**: Solutions to the "Problem of the Day" from various platforms like GeeksForGeeks or LeetCode.
* **`TOP Interview 150`**: My attempts at LeetCode's curated list of the top 150 interview questions.

## ✨ Current Focus

Right now, I'm primarily focused on grinding through the **Strivers SDE Sheet** and the **A2Z Sheet**. My goal is to complete them thoroughly to build a strong base for any coding challenge that comes my way.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I primarily use the following languages for my solutions:

* **Python**
* **C++**
